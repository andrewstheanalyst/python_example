# 🚗 Used Car Price Prediction with Multiple Linear Regression

Welcome to my very first Python project on GitHub! 🎉  
In this project, I use **Multiple Linear Regression** to predict the price of a used car based on several features such as mileage, engine size, fuel type, and more. The dataset is publicly available and contains information on Toyota Corolla cars.

## 📊 Project Overview

This project is a beginner-level data science project that walks through the full machine learning workflow:
- Data loading and exploration
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Building a Multiple Linear Regression model
- Model evaluation
- Visualizations

The goal is to predict the **price** of a used car using its attributes.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used is called `toyotacorolla.csv`, and it is publicly available on GitHub. It includes features such as:
- Age
- KM (Mileage)
- Fuel Type
- HP (Horsepower)
- Automatic (Transmission)
- CC (Engine Size)
- Doors
- Quarterly Tax
- Weight
- Price (Target variable)
